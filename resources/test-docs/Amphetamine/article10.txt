Large Haul of Amphetamines Seized in Single Raid

Pingtung, southern Taiwan, Jan. 17 (CNA) -- In a 
cross-county operation stretching from Tainan to Pingtung, police cracked a 
major drug trafficking ring in southern Taiwan Thursday night, seizing a huge 
cache of amphetamine, weighing 205 kilograms with a street value exceeding NT$1 
billion (US$36.4 million).
Police said they were tipped more than a year ago that a drug ring, allegedly 
headed by a man identified as Wang Chien-hsiung, was planning to produce 
amphetamine in Mainland China and smuggle the illicit drug to Taiwan on fishing 
boats.

After days of tracking suspect Wang, 33, the police raided his apartment in 
Fengshan, Kaohsiung, Thursday night and found the huge cache of amphetamine, 
packed in some 20 bags wrapped in waterproof plastic.
Meanwhile, complaints by amphetamine abusers of being deceived by dealers who 
substitute salt or crystal sugar have continued to increase.
As government efforts to crack down on drug trafficking and abuse have been 
stepped up, making the supply lines and other drug-related activities 
increasingly difficult, some dealers have resorted to using fake products, 
including crystal sugar and salt, to dupe unwitting customers, police sources in 
Hsinchu said Friday.

The price for a small vial (about four centimeters in height) of high-grade 
amphetamine has skyrocketed from the previous NT$1,000 to NT$20,000 nowadays. 
And the drug has become so dear that sometimes no amount of money can procure 
it, the police noted.
