Fiji bans Solomon Airlines on safety grounds

  
  The Fiji government has banned Solomon Airlines from flying into Fiji until it 
improves certain aspects of its aircraft safety standards. As Francis Herman 
reports from Suva, Fiji's Civil Aviation Authority imposed the ban very much in 
line with its counterpart in Australia.
  [Herman] The ban follows Australia's decision to do the same after discovering 
that the Solomon Islands national carrier failed to meet some basic air safety 
standards. The civil aviation authority of Australia cited the airline for a 
range of problems, including inadequate staff training.
  Solomon Airlines operates a weekly service between Honiara and Nadi. Fiji's 
aviation authority chief, Mr Norman Yee, told Radio Fiji that the ban took 
effect from last Friday [10 October]. The ban will remain in force until Solomon 
Airlines satisfies stringent aviation standards set by the Australian 
authorities. In the meantime, Air Vanuatu has agreed to step in to ferry 
passengers booked on Solomon Airlines flights in the region.
