Koizumi calls for airline safety steps in wake of crash

    Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Tuesday told Land, Infrastructure and 
Transport Minister Chikage Ogi to step up safety measures at Japanese airlines 
following Monday's crash in New York of an American Airlines plane, the top 
government spokesman said.

    The premier made the remark to Ogi after the morning's cabinet meeting, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told a press conference.

    The transport ministry earlier Tuesday issued instructions to the Japanese 
airlines to strengthen security measures, ministry officials said.

    The plane carrying 260 passengers and crew members crashed into a 
residential area Monday morning shortly after takeoff from New York's John F.   
Kennedy International Airport.   Everybody on board, and an unknown number of 
residents of the area, are feared dead.
